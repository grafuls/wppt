# wppt
Webhook Payload Proxy Transformer

## What Does This Do?
wppt provides an easy way to intercept, manage, manipulate and re-send a webhook to any Rest API or incoming webhook service (like JIRA).

## Why Is This Needed?
Some services/platforms don't provide an easy-to-use integration vehicle for transforming and syncing requests, payloads and automation e.g. Gitlab -> Jira.  Instead of paying for an expensive third-party service to provide integrations you can do this easily yourself on-premise.
